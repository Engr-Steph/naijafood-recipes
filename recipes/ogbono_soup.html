   <br>Nigerian Ogbono soup
   <p>Ogbono soup is a traditional Nigerian dish made with ground ogbono (wild mango seeds), giving it a thick, draw-like texture. <br>It’s usually cooked with palm oil, assorted meats, fish, and leafy greens for a rich, earthy flavor.</p>

   <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
   <ul>
        Ground ogbono seeds — ½ cup

       <li>Palm oil — 3 tablespoons</li> 

        <li>Assorted meats — 500 g</li>

        <li>Stockfish or dried fish — optional</li>

        <li>Crayfish (ground) — 2 tablespoons</li>

        <li>Pepper and seasoning cubes — to taste</li>

        <li>Salt — to taste</li>

        <li>Meat stock — about 2 cups</li>

        <li>Ugu or spinach — 1 small bunch, chopped</li>

        <li>Locust beans (iru) — optional</li>
   </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and season meats with salt, stock cubes, and pepper, then cook until tender.</li> 
        
        <li>Add stockfish or dried fish if using, and set aside with the stock.</li>

        <li>In another pot, heat palm oil gently and add the ground ogbono. Stir continuously until it melts into the oil and forms a smooth paste.</li>

        <li>Gradually add the meat stock while stirring to avoid lumps; the soup will start to thicken and become stretchy.</li>

        <li>Add crayfish, pepper, seasoning, meats, and fish, then stir well and let it simmer for 5–7 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add chopped vegetables and locust beans if using, stir, and cook for 2–3 more minutes.</li>

        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning, simmer briefly, then serve hot with any swallow of choice.</li>
