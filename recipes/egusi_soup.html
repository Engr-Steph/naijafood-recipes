   <ul>
        <li>Ground egusi (melon seeds) — 1 cup</li>

        <li>Palm oil — 3–4 tablespoons</li>

        <li>Stockfish or dried fish — optional</li>

        <li>Crayfish (ground) — 2 tablespoons</li>

        <li>Pepper and seasoning cubes — to taste</li>

        <li>Salt — to taste</li>

        <li>Meat stock — about 2 cups</li>

        <li>Ugu (fluted pumpkin) or spinach — 1 small bunch, chopped</li>

        <li>Onions — 1 small (blended or chopped)</li>
